        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document 
        written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).CSS is a 
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of 
        content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility
        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics enable multiple web pages to 
        share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
        structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the
        file and its formatting.
