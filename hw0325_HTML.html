    It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and 
    render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
    included cues for its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
    other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured 
    documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and directly introduce content into the page.
    Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.HTML can embed programs written in a scripting 
    language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and 
    layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS 
    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is 
    used to display video and audio, primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.
